    "# Using ESM-2 Protein Language Models for Downstream Biological Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are biological macromolecules composed of amino acids arranged in a linear sequence.\n",
    "The order of amino acids determines a protein’s **structure**, **biochemical activity**, and **biological function**.\n",
    "A central problem in computational biology is therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *How can we infer protein function directly from its amino-acid sequence?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional bioinformatics approaches attempt to answer this using sequence alignment, motif searches, and profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) such as BLAST and Pfam.\n",
    "While powerful, these methods depend heavily on sequence similarity and often fail when analyzing **novel or distantly related proteins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protein Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent advances in machine learning introduced **protein language models (PLMs)**, which treat amino-acid sequences similarly to sentences in natural language processing.\n",
    "One such model is **ESM-2 (Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2)**, a transformer neural network trained on millions of protein sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually engineered biological features, ESM-2 learns representations that encode:\n",
    "\n",
    "* evolutionary conservation\n",
    "* structural patterns\n",
    "* functional residues\n",
    "* biochemical activity\n",
    "\n",
    "For each protein sequence, the model produces a **high-dimensional embedding vector** — a numerical representation capturing its biological properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective of This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how researchers can use ESM-2 as a **general-purpose biological feature extractor** for downstream machine-learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use *enzyme vs non-enzyme classification* as an example problem, but the workflow is designed to be reusable for many biological applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct a labeled dataset directly from UniProt.\n",
    "2. Convert raw protein sequences into embeddings using ESM-2.\n",
    "3. Train downstream machine-learning classifiers on the embeddings.\n",
    "4. Evaluate whether the embeddings encode biochemical function.\n",
    "5. Perform validation analysis to rule out trivial biases (e.g., sequence length).\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, **the ESM-2 model is not trained in this notebook**.\n",
    "Instead, we reuse a pretrained biological representation and show how it can support predictive biology without sequence alignment or manual feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate protein embeddings using a pretrained protein transformer\n",
    "* Cache embeddings efficiently for large datasets\n",
    "* Apply classical machine-learning models to biological representations\n",
    "* Interpret evaluation metrics such as ROC-AUC and F1 score\n",
    "* Validate biological predictions scientifically\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow demonstrated here can be extended to tasks such as protein function prediction, localization prediction, mutation effect prediction, and protein family classification.\n"

    "## Dataset Construction from UniProt (Swiss-Prot Reviewed Proteins)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we construct a labeled machine-learning dataset directly from the UniProt Knowledgebase rather than relying on a pre-curated benchmark dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why build the dataset ourselves?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most biological prediction problems do not come with ready-made labeled datasets.\n",
    "Researchers typically need to derive labels from biological annotations.\n",
    "Here, we use UniProt functional annotations to create a supervised learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a simple but biologically meaningful classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Enzyme (label = 1):** a protein with an Enzyme Commission (EC) number\n",
    "* **Non-enzyme (label = 0):** a protein without an EC number\n",
    "\n",
    "An EC number is a curated biochemical annotation describing catalytic activity.\n",
    "Therefore, its presence provides a reliable proxy label for enzymatic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "We restrict the dataset to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reviewed (Swiss-Prot) proteins** — manually curated and high quality\n",
    "* **Non-fragment sequences** — avoids incomplete proteins\n",
    "* **Sequence length 50–1024 amino acids** — compatible with the ESM-2 model input limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pagination and API usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The UniProt REST API returns results in batches (maximum 500 entries per request).\n",
    "The helper function `fetch_all()` repeatedly follows the API’s `next` link to download all matching entries and assemble them into a single dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this cell is a dataframe containing protein sequences and a binary label indicating enzymatic activity. This dataset will be used to train downstream machine-learning models after generating ESM-2 embeddings.\n"

    "## Data Cleaning and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading entries from UniProt, the dataset requires preprocessing before it can be used for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why cleaning is necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological databases are not designed specifically for machine-learning pipelines.\n",
    "Column naming conventions may vary, and duplicate sequences can occur due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* isoforms\n",
    "* database synchronization differences\n",
    "* annotation updates\n",
    "\n",
    "If duplicates remain in the dataset, the same protein could appear in both the training and test sets.\n",
    "This would cause **data leakage**, where the model memorizes sequences instead of learning biological patterns, leading to artificially inflated accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps performed in this cell\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalize column names**\n",
    "   UniProt exports sometimes include spacing or capitalization differences.\n",
    "   We standardize the sequence column to the consistent name `Sequence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensure sequence type consistency**\n",
    "   Protein sequences are explicitly converted to strings to avoid downstream parsing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove duplicate sequences**\n",
    "   We remove identical amino-acid sequences to guarantee that each protein appears only once in the dataset.\n",
    "   This is essential for a valid train–test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dataset validation**\n",
    "   We print the dataset size and class distribution to confirm that both enzyme and non-enzyme labels are present.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Interpretation of Length Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The length distributions of enzymes and non-enzymes overlap substantially, although enzymes are slightly longer on average.\n",
    "This suggests that sequence length alone cannot reliably separate the two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the model’s performance is not driven by a simple size-based rule but by information contained in the ESM-2 embeddings.\n",
    "This supports the conclusion that pretrained protein language models capture biologically meaningful features useful for downstream prediction tasks.\n"

    "## How ESM-2 Was Used in This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "ESM-2 was used as a pretrained biological representation model rather than a model we trained from scratch.\n",
    "Each protein sequence was passed through the transformer to obtain an embedding vector summarizing structural and functional characteristics learned from large-scale evolutionary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protein sequences were collected from UniProt and labeled using EC annotations.\n",
    "* The ESM-2 model converted each sequence into a fixed-length embedding.\n",
    "* These embeddings served as input features for downstream classifiers (Logistic Regression and a neural network).\n",
    "* The models were evaluated on unseen proteins to test functional prediction.\n",
    "* A length analysis verified that predictions were not based on trivial sequence properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ESM-2 is Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "ESM-2 eliminates the need for traditional feature engineering such as sequence alignment, motif detection, or domain databases.\n",
    "It captures biochemical patterns directly from sequence context, allowing simple machine-learning models to perform functional prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the notebook demonstrates that ESM-2 embeddings act as a general-purpose biological feature representation that researchers can reuse for many downstream tasks beyond enzyme classification.\n"
